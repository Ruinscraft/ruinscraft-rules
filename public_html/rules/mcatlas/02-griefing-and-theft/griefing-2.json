	"rule": "Griefing of unclaimed railways, paths, grinders, portals, hubs, etc. is not allowed (this includes in the Nether). You may alter these builds if you claim them.",
	"reason": "Not all infrastructure made by players can be claimed, and we don't want them to need to claim it! Roads and other infrastructure make the server more connected and help all players. Players destroying these builds creates a negative experience for everyone."
