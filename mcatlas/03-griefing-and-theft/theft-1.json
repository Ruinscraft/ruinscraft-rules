	"rule": "Theft of items (from chests) is discouraged but allowed. Town or Nation bank theft is easily provable and will result in heavy punishment. Ensure you prevent item theft by locking your chests and by configuring your Town settings to only allow trusted players.",
	"reason": "We are unable to prove item theft and tracking down stolen items is virtually impossible. Be sure to follow the steps above so that this is never an issue for yourself. CoMayors and CoKings are allowed to take any amount of gold out of a bank, so be careful who you trust!"
