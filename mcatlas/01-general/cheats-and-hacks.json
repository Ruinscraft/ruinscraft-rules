    "rule": "Do not use client-side cheats or hacks (includes \"X-Ray\" resource packs). You may use client-side modifications which do not provide an advantage in gameplay (Optifine, minimaps, etc). Auto clicking programs or mods are allowed.",
    "reason": "We have this rule because cheats provide an unfair advantage to players who do not use them."
