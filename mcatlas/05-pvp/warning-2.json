	"rule": "Killing or attacking anybody without a fair warning of the fight is not allowed. If a Town already has PvP enabled or you are in the Nether, that is also a fair warning.",
	"reason": "We want to allow players to PvP but with necessary restrictions for players who do not want to participate. Players can enable PvP in their Town or go to the Nether for unrestricted PvPing."
